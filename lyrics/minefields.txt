Faouzia & John Legend Lyrics

"Minefields"

Now this might be a mistake
That I'm calling you this late
But these dreams I have of you ain't real enough

Started bringing uo the past
How the things you love don't last
Even though this isn't fair for both of us

Ooh 
Maybe I'm just a fool
I still belong with you
Anywhere you, anywhere you are
